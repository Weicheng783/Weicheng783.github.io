本站从2023年01月29日启用基于[`Jekyll`][Jekyll-website]的Markdown博客。

[Jekyll-website]: https://jekyllrb.com

Jekyll最大的优点是完全不需要数据库，和Github结合天衣无缝。

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def 打印你好():
  print("你好:)")
#=> 打印 '你好' 到 标准输出 .
{% endhighlight %}
